      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p> Hi, My name is Daisy Nguyen. I was born in Berkeley and I've lived in Castro Valley for the majority of my life. I'm an
        incoming senior at Castro Valley High School. In school, I am an officer of two clubs in school: Teens Reaching Out and
        Girls Learn International. TRO is a community service club and GLI is a club that raises money and awareness for girls' health 
        and education around the world. I am passionate about fighting for social justice. I am the first generation 
        Vietnamese-American in my family.  </p>
