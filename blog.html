<h1> Wednesday 7/12/17 </h1>
<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both workswith robots and they make robots that can have interactions and responses to 
actions thatoccur around them. My team had to figure otut how to build the circuit. After we got the circuit figure out, we all 
contributed ideas to come up with patterns for our LED light show. We could improve our commmunication skills and how we
explain our ideas and thoughts. Every Arduino sketch should have the pin so that the program knows where to put the power. </p>
